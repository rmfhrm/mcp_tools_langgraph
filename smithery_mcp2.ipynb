More than 300 of those detained were South Korean citizens employed by LG and its subcontractors.\\n\\nThe crackdown came as South Korea’s biggest companies have pledged billions of dollars in new investment to boost their manufacturing operations in the U.S. as part of a trade deal reached by President Trump and his South Korean counterpart Lee Jae Myung this year.\\n\\nTrump announced in late July that tariffs on most imports from South Korea would be only 15% after South Korea agreed to invest $350 billion in key U.S. industries and purchase $100 billion worth of its liquefied natural gas.\\n\\nThe fact that the raid targeted one of Korea’s most ambitious investments in the U.S. at a time when the country is trying to rapidly ramp up its commitments prompted disbelief and indignation for some in Seoul.\\n\\nIn a news conference Sunday, ruling party lawmaker Oh Gi-hyoung stated that South Koreans should be treated with a level of respect commensurate with their country’s status as a major U.S. ally and investor.\\n\\nThe U.S. currently accounts for the greatest share of South Korea’s overseas investments, receiving $26 billion last year, according to South Korea’s Finance Ministry. South Korea is the U.S.’ 8th largest trading partner, with the two countries exchanging $242.5 billion in goods and services last year.\\n\\n“If the U.S. genuinely wants to attract investment from South Korean companies, things like this cannot happen,” Oh said.\\n\\nIn a statement released Friday, the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of Georgia said the operation — which was the largest single-site raid in the Department of Homeland Security’s history — was part of a nationwide initiative, known as Operation Take Back America, to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration.”\\n\\nICE has said that those arrested were found to be working illegally, many on “short-term or recreational visas,” which do not allow visitors to work.\\n\\nAs of 2022, around 110,000 unauthorized South Korean immigrants were living in the U.S., representing 1% of the total, according to data compiled by the Pew Research Center.\\n\\nEven if there is a swift release of the workers, experts in South Korea said this heavy-handed action could impact how the Asian nation sees its trade relationship with the U.S.\\n\\nIndustry experts say that the crackdown could lead to logistical challenges for both ongoing and future efforts by South Korean companies in the U.S.\\n\\nSouth Korea recently announced a $150-billion project to help revive a declining American shipbuilding industry. In addition, nearly 10 other battery plant projects are underway across the U.S.\\n\\nFor years, companies here have dispatched their own technical specialists to oversee the construction of U.S. factories using nonwork travel permits such as ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization), a visa waiver that allows tourists to stay in the country for up to 90 days.\\n\\nThough technically the visas do not allow holders to work, “it was tolerated for a long time by U.S. authorities,” said Hwang In-song, an industrial policy expert at the Korea Electronics Technology Institute, a government think tank.\\n\\nSouth Korean companies have long complained that the visas legally required for their dispatched workers are too time-consuming and challenging to obtain.\\n\\nFor example, the H-1B visa, which allows people to work, is awarded through a lottery held once a year. And getting one has gotten increasingly difficult under Trump, who has limited its eligibility under the banner of “Buy American, Hire American.”\\n\\n“South Korean companies are reluctant to go that route because it takes at least 8 months of lead time before you can begin working on an H-1B, and there is no guarantee you will get it,” said Chun Jong-joon, a Korean American immigration lawyer based in Washington.\\n\\nHwang said it is nearly impossible to find enough Americans with the skills needed to staff South Korea’s U.S. factories, including for lithium-ion battery manufacturing or shipbuilding.\\n\\n“As of now, there’s no way other than sending experienced South Korean specialists to help,” Hwang said.\\n\\nAfter the release of the detained workers, South Korean officials said that they would pursue improvements to U.S. work permits for South Korean citizens.\\n\\nChile, Australia and Singapore have special work visa programs that allow their citizens to work in specialized roles in the U.S.\\n\\nUntil then, the arrests at the Georgia battery plant will probably mean months of costly delays, as the joint venture struggles to redeploy workers.\\n\\n“In the case of LG Energy Solutions, they will have to think twice before sending their workers to the Georgia plant,” Hwang said.\",\"canonical_link\":\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-09-07/seoul-says-it-has-reached-a-deal-for-release-of-hyundai-workers-caught-in-georgia-raid\",\"meta_keywords\":[\"\"],\"publish_date\":\"2025-09-07T00:00:00\",\"authors\":[\"Max

senators say his moves on vaccines are risky for public health. They also may be bad politics.\",\"text\":\"Seven months after they voted to confirm longtime anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the nation’s health secretary, some Republican senators are having second thoughts.\\n\\n“I’m a doctor. Vaccines work,” Sen. John Barrasso (Wyoming), the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, told Kennedy at a hearing Thursday on Capitol Hill. “Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearings, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I’ve grown deeply concerned.”\\n\\nBarrasso’s warning, which Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) and Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) echoed at Thursday’s hearing, was the latest and perhaps most significant sign of growing GOP doubts about the merits — and political wisdom — of Kennedy’s agenda.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFabrizio/Ward, a conservative polling firm, privately warned GOP lawmakers last week that overhauling vaccine policies is politically dangerous, citing data that nearly three-quarters of Trump voters believe vaccines save lives.\\n\\nOfficials from Trump’s first administration are also increasingly condemning Kennedy in public remarks. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health in the first Trump administration, told The Washington Post on Friday that Kennedy’s decision to end nearly $500 million in federal funding for mRNA vaccine development was “going to make the country vulnerable” and that the health secretary’s broader vaccine agenda was doing “tremendous damage” to public health.\\n\\nMembers of Congress are speaking out, too: At Thursday’s hearing, senators from both sides of the aisle peppered Kennedy with questions about his abrupt ousting of the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, his efforts to narrow access to coronavirus vaccines and other moves.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNow, some Republican senators and pharmaceutical executives are mounting a push to belatedly recognize Trump for his first administration’s coronavirus vaccine program — identifying it as a way to drive a wedge between the president and Kennedy, who has previously claimed that the shots are “the deadliest vaccine ever made.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe fight over Kennedy reflects a deeper division in the GOP about vaccines, which played a role in his heated confirmation battle. Every GOP senator except for Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), a polio survivor, ultimately voted to confirm him in February, with many of Kennedy’s supporters saying that he was raising valid questions about vaccine mandates and other policies.\\n\\nSo far, Trump is standing behind his controversial Cabinet pick. In response to a journalist’s question Thursday about whether Kennedy retained his full support after the blistering hearing, the president praised Kennedy “as a very good person” who “means very well” and is a “different” thinker, but did not directly answer the question. The president also stressed in remarks Friday that he supported widespread use of certain vaccines.\\n\\n“You have to be very careful when you say that some people don’t have to be vaccinated,” said Trump, after being asked about Florida’s move to roll back vaccine mandates for children. “ … Look, you have vaccines that work. They just pure and simple work. They’re not controversial at all. And I think those vaccines should be used.”\\n\\nA panel of CDC advisers, handpicked by Kennedy, is reviewing the federal government’s recommendations for how and when children are immunized in the United States. Public health experts have opposed the effort, stressing that the existing recommendations for vaccines are safe and effective.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhite House officials said Friday that the bond between Trump and Kennedy remains strong, and that the administration helped arrange an appearance for Kennedy on Fox News on Sunday.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“The White House maintains full confidence in Secretary Kennedy’s leadership at HHS to advance President Trump’s MAHA agenda,” spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement.\\n\\nKennedy has characterized the Senate’s rationale for holding the hearing as “performative.” He added that he inherited a flawed agency that requires dramatic changes to boost America’s lagging public health outcomes.\\n\\n“I’ve been brought in as a new manager,” Kennedy said Sunday on Fox News. “My job is to shake up the organization.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt was not immediately clear who commissioned the polling shown to GOP lawmakers before the hearing, which was planned before Kennedy forced out CDC director Susan Monarez. Kennedy on Thursday challenged public assertions she made on her way out that he has injected politics into public health.\\n\\n“I’m not taking vaccines away from anybody,” he said in a heated exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), insisting in response to questioning that he is simply focused on collecting more evidence for vaccine efficacy.\\n\\n“HHS remains committed to upholding gold-standard science and supporting the doctor-patient relationship, empowering Americans to make informed decisions about vaccines,” spokeswoman Emily Hilliard said in a statement. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary also said Thursday on CNN that his agency is doing a “proper investigation” into how many children died from the coronavirus vaccine and plans to release a report in the “coming few weeks.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt is also not clear if the growing GOP concerns will have a material effect on Kennedy or his team’s agenda. But his recent moves have exposed the political fault lines over vaccine policy, which could be further exacerbated by the health department’s upcoming moves to issue an autism report and potentially further limit access to coronavirus vaccines.\\n\\nWhite House officials and Kennedy allies have pointed to polling that indicates Kennedy is the most popular member of the Trump administration, and Trump and his advisers believe that Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement helped swing the 2024 election — and could boost Republicans in the 2026 midterms.\\n\\nCassidy, the chairman of the Senate’s health committee, has pledged to do “oversight” on the firing of Monarez, who Kennedy in the interim has replaced with one of his top deputies. Cassidy’s office declined to comment on the senator’s specific plans for oversight of Kennedy’s team. Several GOP lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota), have voiced frustration over Monarez’s ouster just weeks after the Senate devoted valuable floor time to confirming her.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nStill, other congressional Republicans remain staunchly pro-Kennedy, including a pair of GOP physicians, Sens. Roger Marshall (Kansas) and Rand Paul (Kentucky), and Sen. Ron Johnson (Wisconsin), who argued in Thursday’s hearing that evidence linking vaccines to higher rates of chronic disease has been suppressed.\\n\\n“In 15 years in the Senate, I think RFK Jr. has been probably treated the most disrespectfully as I’ve ever seen a witness treated,” Johnson said on Newsmax on Friday. He argued that the backlash to Kennedy was driven by lawmakers’ past support for coronavirus vaccines, which he called dangerous. “One of the things I pointed out in the hearing, all these senators — and here’s part of the problem — none of them want to admit they are wrong,” Johnson said.\\n\\nOperation Warp Speed at issue\\n\\nKennedy’s critics hope that his skepticism of coronavirus vaccines could drive a wedge between him and Trump. The president has argued that he has not received enough recognition for Operation Warp Speed, which public health experts and think tanks have credited with saving millions of lives across the world but which became unpopular with some of his political base.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCassidy and Albert Bourla, the CEO of pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which produced one of the mRNA coronavirus vaccines, have called for Trump to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to accelerate coronavirus vaccine development. Kennedy told the Senate that he agreed that Trump deserved the honor, but has previously criticized Warp Speed and generally remains hesitant to champion it.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAsked by a host on “Fox & Friends” on Sunday about the “last great success” of government health agencies, Kennedy said he could not identify one.\\n\\n“I don’t think there have been successes,” Kennedy said. “I think we’ve seen a 30- or 40-year decline in the agency because, you know, it’s been infiltrated by the pharmaceutical companies and they’ve made a series of bad decisions.”\\n\\nAt a fundraiser attended by Bourla earlier this year, the president said that he wished he could take more credit for the initiative but it was politically difficult to do so, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private comments. The Wall Street Journal first reported Trump’s comments.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCassidy has consulted public health and other medical experts with questions around vaccines and for help identifying information about claims Kennedy has made in the past, according to three people familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), who pressed Kennedy in his confirmation hearing about his vaccine stance, have also publicly called for oversight of his CDC moves.\\n\\nKennedy’s direction on vaccines “goes against some of the commitments that he made to me and presumably to others,” Murkowski told reporters last week.\\n\\nSome Kennedy allies and MAHA advocates have dismissed his critics’ mounting focus on vaccines, saying that it overlooks Kennedy’s priority to address chronic disease and his early achievements, such as his push to get synthetic dyes out of food.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“We are asking and behind closed doors, how do we get kids to eat healthier food? How do we get kids to exercise more? … We are talking at the highest levels about the most positive things,” Calley Means, the White House’s MAHA adviser, said on Fox News on Thursday night.\\n\\nGiroir and others say they support the administration’s agenda to tackle chronic disease, but not the person driving it.\\n\\n“I think America needs MAHA, but without the mayhem,” Giroir said.\\n\\nBut as the midterm elections draw closer, Kennedy may face even more skepticism from Republicans in Congress — and from voters. “Republicans should not mistake skepticism over the COVID vaccine as evidence that Republican voters are against all vaccinations. To do so would be folly,” Fabrizio/Ward warned in its polling memo, which was shared in a briefing with Senate Republican offices on Wednesday and first reported by Bloomberg News. “Moreover, support for vaccines is sky-high among Swing voters — the people who don’t vote along straight party lines and tend to decide close elections.”\",\"canonical_link\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/07/rfk-gop-maga-maha-vaccines/\",\"meta_keywords\":[\"\"],\"publish_date\":\"2025-09-07T00:00:00\",\"authors\":[\"Dan Diamond\",\"Theodoric Meyer\",\"Rachel Roubein\",\"Hannah Knowles\",\"Clara Ence Morse\",\"Josh Partlow\",\"Mariana Alfaro\",\"Annabelle Timsit\",\"Michelle Lee\",\"Douglas MacMillan\"],\"title\":\"Doubts about RFK Jr. grow for some Republicans\",\"meta_img\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PEESRTIB7WXOCPVNK5ZU7EHXOM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440\",\"images\":[\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PEESRTIB7WXOCPVNK5ZU7EHXOM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PEESRTIB7WXOCPVNK5ZU7EHXOM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PEESRTIB7WXOCPVNK5ZU7EHXOM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PEESRTIB7WXOCPVNK5ZU7EHXOM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PEESRTIB7WXOCPVNK5ZU7EHXOM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PEESRTIB7WXOCPVNK5ZU7EHXOM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PEESRTIB7WXOCPVNK5ZU7EHXOM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440&impolicy=high_res 1440w\",\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dr/resources/images/generic-newsletter-signup.png\",\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dr/resources/images/generic-newsletter-signup.png\"],\"language\":\"en\",\"read_more_link\":\"\",\"summary\":\"\"},{\"meta_site_name\":\"CNN\",\"movies\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/07/politics/immigration-enforcement-surge-in-massachusetts\",\"keywords\":[],\"top_image\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-08-19t162446z-42259325-rc2eagav710l-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-boston.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"meta_lang\":\"en\",\"meta_favicon\":\"/media/sites/cnn/apple-touch-icon.png\",\"meta_description\":\"The Trump administration launched a new federal immigration enforcement effort in Massachusetts focused on deporting criminals who entered the country illegally, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\",\"text\":\"The Trump administration launched a new federal immigration enforcement effort in Massachusetts focused on deporting criminals who entered the country illegally, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\n“ICE launched ‘Patriot 2.0’ to target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens living in the state of Massachusetts, following the success of Operation Patriot in May,” a DHS spokesperson told CNN on Sunday.\\n\\nThe statement blamed Boston Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu for so-called sanctuary city polices that it said “not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens,” vowing that DHS will arrest criminals released by local authorities.\\n\\n“Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, nowhere is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens.

During the first saint-making Mass of his pontificate, Leo also canonized another popular Italian figure who died young, Pier Giorgio Frassati.\\n\\nWATCH: Politics, miracles and the process of picking a modern saint\\n\\nLeo said both men created “masterpieces” out of their lives by dedicating them to God.\\n\\n“The greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God’s plan,” Leo said in his homily. The new saints “are an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards and make them masterpieces.”\\n\\nAn ordinary life that became extraordinary\\n\\nAcutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy but not particularly observant Catholic family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born and he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood, albeit marked by increasingly intense religious devotion.\\n\\nAcutis was particularly interested in computer science and devoured college-level books on programming even as a youngster. He earned the nickname “God’s Influencer,” thanks to his main tech legacy: a multilingual website documenting so-called Eucharistic miracles recognized by the church, a project he completed at a time when the development of such sites was the domain of professionals.\\n\\nHe was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day. The Catholic hierarchy has been trying to promote the practice of Eucharistic adoration because, according to polls, most Catholics don’t believe Christ is physically present in the Eucharistic hosts.\\n\\nBut Acutis limited himself to an hour of video games a week, apparently deciding long before TikTok that human relationships were far more important than virtual ones. That discipline and restraint has proved appealing to the Catholic hierarchy, which has sounded the alarm about the dangers of today’s tech-driven society.\\n\\nIn October 2006, at age 15, Acutis fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. Within days, he was dead. He was entombed in Assisi, which known for its association with another popular saint, St. Francis.\\n\\nMillions flock to Acutis’ tomb\\n\\nIn the years since his death, young Catholics have flocked by the millions to Assisi, where they can see the young Acutis through a glass-sided tomb, dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt. He seems as if he’s sleeping, and questions have swirled about how his body was so well preserved, especially since parts of his heart have even toured the world as relics.\\n\\nBoth saint-making ceremonies had been scheduled for earlier this year, but were postponed following Pope Francis’ death in April. Francis had fervently pushed the Acutis sainthood case forward, convinced that the church needed someone like him to attract young Catholics to the faith while addressing the promises and perils of the digital age.\\n\\n“It’s like I can maybe not be as great as Carlo may be, but I can be looking after him and be like, ‘What would Carlo do?’” said Leo Kowalsky, an 8th grader at a Chicago school attached to the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish.\\n\\nKowalsky said he was particularly excited that his own namesake — Pope Leo — would be canonizing the patron of his school. “It’s kind of all mashed up into one thing, so it is a joy to be a part of,” Kowalsky said in an interview last week.\\n\\nMuch of Acutis’ popularity is thanks to a concerted campaign by the Vatican to give the next generation of faithful a “saint next door” who was ordinary but did extraordinary things in life. In Acutis, they found a relatable tech-savvy millennial — the term used to describe a person born roughly between 1981 and 1996 who was the first generation to reach adulthood in the new millennium.\\n\\nThe Vatican said 36 cardinals, 270 bishops and hundreds of priests had signed up to celebrate the Mass along with Leo in a sign of the saints’ enormous appeal to the hierarchy and ordinary faithful alike.\\n\\nPopular piety for the digital age\\n\\nAn hour before the Mass, St. Peter’s Square was already full with pilgrims, many of them young millennial Italians, many with toddlers in strollers.\\n\\n“I learned from different people what his professors, his teachers said about his joy and the light he carried around him,” said Leopoldo Antimi, a 27-year-old Roman who got to the square early to secure a spot. “So for me personally as an Italian, even on social networks that are used so much, it is important to have him as an influencer.”\\n\\nREAD MORE: Pope Leo XIV gets rock star’s welcome at Vaticans’ Catholic influencer festival\\n\\nMatthew Schmalz, professor of religious studies at Holy Cross college in Worcester, Massachusetts, said Acutis’ canonization extends the church tradition of popular piety to the digital age.\\n\\n“He becomes an emblem or model of how Catholics should approach and use the digital world–with discipline and with a focus on traditional Catholic spirituality that defies the passage of time,” he said in statement. “He is a new saint of simplicity for the ever complex digital landscape of contemporary Catholicism.”\\n\\nFrassati, the other saint being canonized Sunday, lived from 1901-1925, when he died at age 24 of polio. He was born into a prominent Turin family but is known for his devotion to serving the poor and carrying out acts of charity while spreading his faith to his friends.\\n\\nAP visual journalists Trisha Thomas in Vatican City and Jessie Wardarski in Chicago contributed to this report.\",\"canonical_link\":\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pope-leo-xiv-canonizes-gods-influencer-carlo-acutis-as-the-first-millennial-saint\",\"meta_keywords\":[\"\"],\"publish_date\":\"2025-09-07T12:58:53-04:00\",\"authors\":[\"Nicole Winfield\",\"Associated Press\"],\"title\":\"Pope Leo XIV canonizes ‘God’s influencer’ Carlo Acutis as the first millennial saint\",\"meta_img\":\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/2025-09-07T121411Z_1339148042_RC2XMGAGYY3S_RTRMADP_3_VATICAN-SAINTS-ACUTIS-BRAZIL-1024x683.jpg\",\"images\":[\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/2025-09-07T121411Z_1339148042_RC2XMGAGYY3S_RTRMADP_3_VATICAN-SAINTS-ACUTIS-BRAZIL-1024x683.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/07/web-ad-1.png\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/bdo.png\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/bnsf-railway.png\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/consumer-cellular.png\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/raymond-james.png\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/viewers.png\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/fonh.png\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/bdo.png\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/bnsf-railway.png\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/consumer-cellular.png\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/raymond-james.png\",\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/sponsors/viewers-like-you.png\"],\"language\":\"en\",\"read_more_link\":\"\",\"summary\":\"\"},{\"meta_site_name\":\"\",\"movies\":[],\"url\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tammy-duckworth-chicago-trump-national-guard/\",\"keywords\":[],\"top_image\":\"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/07/29ade337-705e-4f28-bb7a-a5de5df00ee9/thumbnail/1200x630/f1db4fccc614aeb2647811e9d845d580/0907-ftn-duckworth.jpg\",\"meta_lang\":\"en\",\"meta_favicon\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/fly/bundles/cbsnewscore/icons/icon.svg\",\"meta_description\":\"Sen.

He is expected to seek congressional approval.\\n\\nMr. Trump told reporters Sunday that \\\"we're not going to war.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend,\\\" the president said. \\\"That's not war, that's common sense.\\\"\\n\\nThe post marked the latest in a series of threats Mr. Trump has made to send troops to Chicago as part of a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime, following his decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in June. California Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged the legality of that deployment, and a judge ruled last week that it violated federal law, although the ruling appeared to only apply to California.\\n\\nDespite Mr. Trump's rhetoric, Vice President JD Vance said in recent days that the administration has \\\"no immediate plans\\\" to send National Guard forces to Chicago. The comments came one day after Mr. Trump again suggested he would send federal forces to Chicago, saying \\\"we're going in.\\\"\\n\\nStill, Duckworth said she takes what the president says seriously.\\n\\n\\\"I take what the president of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office,\\\" Duckworth said. \\\"And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear: it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.\\\"\\n\\nDuckworth was among a group of Illinois leaders who visited the Naval Station Great Lakes Saturday, following news that some federal immigration enforcement agents will be based there. She said military leadership confirmed that the only assistance they've been requested to provide to the federal government is for office space for ICE.\\n\\n\\\"No barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago,\\\" Duckworth said.\\n\\nThe Illinois Democrat said \\\"we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiries about what they are planning on doing,\\\" adding that the administration hasn't reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate.\\n\\n\\\"If they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, 'What do you need? What help do you need?'\\\" Duckworth said. \\\"And we've not gotten any, any communications or feedback from the administration whatsoever.\\\"\\n\\nThe developments come after Mr. Trump deployed the National Guard in Washington, D.C. last month as part of an anti-crime initiative, while vowing to intervene in cities like Chicago and Baltimore next.\\n\\nLocal leaders have pushed back on the federal government's threats to intervene on crime in Chicago, which could draw legal challenges.\",\"canonical_link\":\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tammy-duckworth-chicago-trump-national-guard/\",\"meta_keywords\":[\"\"],\"publish_date\":\"2025-09-07T11:51:00-04:00\",\"authors\":[\"Kaia  Hubbard\"],\"title\":\"Sen.
